# MonkeyMux

MonkeyMux is MonkeySSH's purpose-built remote terminal multiplexer. It is a
per-user helper that runs on the SSH target and exposes:

- `monkeymux attach <session>` for the foreground terminal path.
- `monkeymux control <session> --json` for newline-delimited JSON control.

The foreground path is intentionally a direct byte relay. MonkeyMux does not
parse, cache, wrap, or rewrite terminal control sequences in the hot path. All
structured state and commands belong on the control backchannel.

The initial target matrix is POSIX-first: Linux and macOS on amd64 and arm64.
Windows support is a later ConPTY-backed follow-up.
